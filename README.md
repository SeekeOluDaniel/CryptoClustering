# CryptoClustering
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to perform clustering analysis on a dataset of cryptocurrencies to identify meaningful patterns and groupings based on their performance metrics. This analysis aims to aid in understanding the behavior and characteristics of different cryptocurrencies in the market. Specifically, explore if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes and group them based on profitability.


## Technology/Tools/Libraries:
Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Scikit-learn, K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Plotly, HvPlot, StandardScaler


## Steps
Detailed comments are provided in the Jupyter Notebook. Below are the general steps taken to complete the project:

Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset and performing data cleaning and normalization.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing the data to understand distributions and relationships between variables.
Feature Selection and Scaling: Selecting relevant features for clustering and applying standard scaling techniques.
Dimensionality Reduction: Using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for easier visualization and analysis.
Clustering Analysis: Implementing K-means clustering to group cryptocurrencies into distinct clusters.
Visualization: Creating interactive visualizations using Plotly and HvPlot to display the clustering results and interpret the findings.

## Outcome:
The project successfully identified and visualized distinct clusters of cryptocurrencies based on their performance metrics. The clustering results provided valuable insights into the different characteristics and behaviors of cryptocurrencies in the market, which can be used for further analysis and decision-making.
